# CSAS 2025 - Introduction to Visualization

Date: April 11, 2025 

Time: 3:40 - 4:50 

Workshop Leader: [Rahul Manna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-manna-544590346/)


## Introduction

Visualizing data, particularly in sports analytics, provides valuable insights for informed decision-making, reveals underlying patterns in the data, and enhances communication among stakeholders. Leveraging Python’s versatility and powerful data visualization libraries enables the creation of well-crafted visual narratives across diverse domains. Matplotlib, Python's most popular visualization package, offers extensive customization options and precise control, making it a preferred tool for crafting detailed and impactful visualizations. This workshop will introduce Matplotlib’s robust plotting capabilities, showcase practical examples of data visualizations in baseball and basketball, and equip participants with versatile techniques applicable across any domain.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 
Recommended: familiarity with Pandas.
