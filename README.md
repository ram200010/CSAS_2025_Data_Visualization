## Introduction

Visualizing data, particularly in sports analytics, provides valuable insights for informed decision-making, reveals underlying patterns in the data, and enhances communication among stakeholders. Leveraging Python’s versatility and powerful data visualization libraries enables the creation of well-crafted visual narratives across diverse domains. Matplotlib, Python's most popular visualization package, offers extensive customization options and precise control, making it a preferred tool for crafting detailed and impactful visualizations. This workshop will introduce Matplotlib’s robust plotting capabilities, showcase practical examples of data visualizations in baseball and basketball, and equip participants with versatile techniques applicable across any domain.

## Follow Along During Demo

We will be using Google Colaborate for a code demo. Participants can choose to follow along on their own laptops. 

**If you have a gmail account**: If you do not have python installed but have a gmail account, you can follow along with Google Colaborate. 

1. Click on the following link: [Demo File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYOicZ42JHqbp2-3euIj5pN72ivoOq2d/view?usp=sharing)
2. Click on "Open With"
3. Click on `Connect More Apps`
4. Search and install `Colaboratory`
5. Click on **Open with Google Colaboratory**
6. Click on `Copy to Drive` to create your own copy and save progress.

<br/>

**If you do not have gmail account but have python installed**: If you have already downloaded and install python, you can install jupter notebooks with the following command in your terminal/command prompt.

1. To install Jupyter Notebook, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
    pip install notebook
```

2. Download the demo.ipynb file
3. To open a Jupyter Notebook file, open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the `demo.ipynb` file.
4. Then type the following command in your terminal.

```bash
    jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
 ```

*Note: If you have Visual Studio Code installed, you can install the **Jupyter** extension and open the `demo.ipynb`.*

## Instructor
Rahul Manna is a junior pursuing a dual degree in Statistical Data Science and Mechanical Engineering. He is currently working as a research assistant in the Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing Reliability (KKim Lab), where he tests materials for implantable bioelectronics and uses Python and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize data. Outside the classroom and workspace, Rahul enjoys Formula One, where the fusion of cutting-edge engineering, advanced statistics, data science, analytics, and human ingenuity drives both the on-track performances and the strategic decisions behind the scenes



## Data

Data used in this workshop is obtained from Baseball Savant and NBA API with the `pybaseball` and `nba_api` packages.
